1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,003
When she was younger she would pretend

2
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,760
When she was younger she would pretend

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,070
That her bedroom was a castle she was fairest in the land

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,560
And she got older and it all changed

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,140
There was no time for make believe and all the magic slipped away

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,820
Until the light in her eyes it was all but gone

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,080
Cause all the dreams that she had turned out to be wrong

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,880
So keep your head up princess 'fore your crown falls

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,650
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,570
I know it gets so hard but you don't got far to go

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,140
Yeah keep your head up princess it's a long road

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,870
And the path leads right to where they won't go

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,625
I know it hurts right now but I know you'll make it home
